<!-- Starting from a blank HTML file, create an object with 10 questions. The object should be structured as follows: q1: ["QUESTION", "ANSWER"] q2: ["QUESTION", "ANSWER"]

Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting t (for true) or f (for false).

Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.

BONUS: Keep track of the user's score.

HINT: Don't worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working code first. -->
